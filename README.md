# <BenakaBliskaRowley_ENV872_EDA_FinalProject>

## Summary

The purpose of this repository is to store project files for our final project in Environmental Data Analytics (ENV872). The final project was created by Isaac Benaka, Hanna Bliska, and Caroline Rowley and was conducted at the conclusion of our course in November and December of 2022. The final project focuses on mangrove conservation in the Florida Everglades. 

The repository contains raw, processed, and spatial data utilized for the final project's analysis. The repository also contains the code written for data exploration, wrangling, and analysis, as well as our final project RMarkdown file. 

The objective of the analysis was to determine areas within the Everglades National Park that should be conserved due to risk to mangrove habitats. The analysis focuses on identifying changes in mangrove health, nutrient availability, and mangrove-associated species.

## Database Information

### Florida Coastal Everglades LTER Data Sets
Data were collected from the Environmental Data Initiative Data Portal (https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp). From the Advanced Search, the following search was made: 
*Sites: selected Florida Coastal Everglades

We then selected the following data sets:
1. Water Quality Data (Grab Samples) from the Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park (FCE LTER), May 2001 - ongoing
2. Mangrove Forest Growth from the Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park (FCE), South Florida, USA, January 1995 - ongoing

csv files were saved as `FCE_LTER_Nutrients` and `FCE_LTER_Mangroves`, respectively.

Data on site coordinates were collected from the Florida Coastal Everglades LTER webpage (https://fce-lter.fiu.edu/research/sites/coordinates/). The csv file was saved as `FCE_LTER_site_coordinates.csv`

Data were accessed on 2022-11-15.

### Mangrove Distribution Data
Mangrove habitat spatial data was collected from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission GIS & Mapping Data website (https://geodata.myfwc.com/datasets/myfwc::mangrove-habitat-in-florida-1/about). The shapefile data were saved as `Mangrove_Habitat_in_Florida` under the Spatial data folder.

National Park boundary data was collected from the National Park Service DataStore (https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2224545?lnv=True). The Administrative Boundaries of the National Park System shapefile was saved as `nps_boundary` under the Spatial data folder.

Data were accessed on 2022-11-18.

### iNaturalist Data
iNaturalist data was collected from inaturalist.org/observations/export using the export tool. Three datasets were created using a query, selecting for research grade only observations of reptiles, mammals, and birds within the boundaries of Everglades National Park, US, FL. 

We then selected the columns included in the data set: id, observed_on_string, observed_on, time_observed_at, latitude, longitude, scientific_name, common_name, iconic_taxon_name, taxon_id, taxon_order_name, and taxon_genus_name.

The csv files were saved as `inaturalist_reptiles2`, `inaturalist_mammals`, and `inaturalist_reptiles2` in the raw data folder.

Data were accessed on 2022-11-28.

## Quality assurance/quality control

To ensure basic quality control, we underwent the following procedures:

1. Instrument-collected data: The nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations measured in the `FCE_LTER_Nutrients.csv` data set were collected via ISCO autosamplers, a water quality measurement instrument. It is best practice to ensure that instrument-collected data is reasonable given the instrument and within range (DataONE, 2022). Therefore, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were checked to ensure there were no values below zero and that there were no outliers surpassing the expected range of the values.
2. Dates and times: Several data sets (e.g., `FCE_LTER_Nutrients.csv`, ``FCE_LTER_Mangroves.csv`) included dates and times of observations. To ensure quality control, we implemented the best practice to ensure dates and times observed were accurate and logical (DataONE, 2022).
3. Geographic coordinates: We obtained geographic coordinates (`FCE_LTER_site_coordinates.csv`) for the mangrove long-term monitoring sites. To ensure quality control, we plotted the site coordinates using MapViewer to ensure the coordinates did not include errors (DataONE, 2022).
4. iNaturalist data: only research grade observations were accepted into the data set. Limitations of this data set are discussed in the **insert section** of the report.
5. Ensured that classes in dataframes were consistent with the type of data contained in columns.
