# <BenakaBliskaRowley_ENV872_EDA_FinalProject>

## Summary

This purpose of this repository is to store project files for our final project in Environmental Data Analytics (ENV872). The final project was created by Isaac Benaka, Hanna Bliska, and Caroline Rowley and was conducted at the conclusion of our course in November and December of 2022. The final project focuses on mangrove conservation in the Florida Everglades. 

The repository contains raw, processed, and spatial data utilized for the final project's analysis. The repository also contains the code written for data exploration, wrangling, and analysis, as well as our final project RMarkdown file. 

The objective of the analysis was to determine areas within the Everglades National Park that should be conserved due to risk to mangrove habitats. The analysis focuses on identifying changes in mangrove health, nutrient availability, and mangrove-associated species.

## Database Information

### Florida Coastal Everglades Data Sets
Data were collected from the Environmental Data Initiative Data Portal (https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp). From the Advanced Search, the following search was made: 
*Sites: selected Florida Coastal Everglades

We then selected the following data sets:
1. Water Quality Data (Grab Samples) from the Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park (FCE LTER), May 2001 - ongoing
2. Mangrove Forest Growth from the Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park (FCE), South Florida, USA, January 1995 - ongoing

csv files were saved as `FCE_LTER_Nutrients` and 
`FCE_LTER_Mangroves`, respectively.

Data on site coordinated were collected from the Florida Coastal Everglades LTER webpage (https://fce-lter.fiu.edu/research/sites/coordinates/). The csv file was saved as `FCE_LTER_site_coordinates.csv`

Data were accessed on 2022-11-15.

### Mangrove Distribution Data

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>

### iNaturalist Data

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

<describe the folders contained in the repository, including what type of files they contain>

### Folder Structure
1. Code: Contains the RMarkdown files for our data exploration, analysis, and wranging code. All of the final code was then merged into our final project code, saved as `Benaka_Bliska_Rowley_Final_Project.rmd`
2. Data: Contains the raw, processed, and spatial data for our final project.
  *Raw: holds raw data files (.csv format)
  *Processed: holds processed data files (.csv format)
  *Spatial: holds spatial data files (.shp format)
3. Output: Contains final visualizations from analysis (.jpg format)

### Naming Conventions and File Formats
Files are named according to the following naming convention: `databaseinfo_datatype.format`, where: 

**databaseinfo** describes the database where the data were obtained from 

**datatype** notes the main type of data in the file (e.g., nutrient data)

**format** indicates the format of the file (e.g., .csv, .txt, .shp, .Rmd)
